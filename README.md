### **Nashville Housing Data Cleaning using Microsoft SQL Server. Like our house, we love our data clean.**

* **Description: In this project we take raw housing data and transform it in SQL Server to make it more usable for analysis. I driven a cleaning data process to prepare data for analysis by modifying incomplete data, removing irrelevant and duplicated rows, splitting addresses, and modifying improperly formatted data. Data cleaning is not about erasing information to simplify the dataset, but rather finding a way to maximize the accuracy of the collected data. The dataset contains 56,000+ rows of Nashville Housing Data.**


**Skills required for this project:- Excel, MYSQL, Data cleaning, Data Loading, Data Analysis, Data Visualization.**
